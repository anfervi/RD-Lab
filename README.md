Autoritas R&amp;D Laboratory
----------------------------

Autoritas is a global consultancy on Smart Listening. We are developing our own Smart Listening tool named Cosmos. Cosmos is a set of linguistics and machine learning libraries with a powerful interface. The aim is at obtaining knowledge from data. Autoritas invests huge amounts of money, time and effort in Research and Development and we would like to share some of our resources with the community. 

This Git repository is organised as follows:

- data: collected and annotated datasets
- doc: published papers, presentations and research projects results
- resources: a set of different kind of resources such as lexicons 
- src: source code and tools

Autoritas is continually researching, hence this repository may change. We recommend to visit it regularly. 

We hope you take advantage of it!
